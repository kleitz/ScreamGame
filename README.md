## **Libraries:**

Install the following in the Linux terminal

```
$ sudo pip3 install numpy 

$ sudo pip3 install scipy

$ sudo pip3 install pygame

$ sudo pip3 install pyaudio
```

## **Running the code:**

Run main.py with the following command in the terminal:

```
$ python3 main.py
```

For the player controlling the environment: Scream three times to calibrate (instructions on the terminal window). Continue on with game - you must scream to activate the death traps (that are located in the sky) to kill the player.


For the player controlling the character: Use the arrow keys to move (left and right) or jump (up) across terrain and to avoid obstacles (air death traps, spikes, wind, and fake ground) to get to the end of the level (when the end of the screen is reached).
